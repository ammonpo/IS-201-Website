                        <p>I believe that college and life in general is in large part about developing skills and interests that not only make you more marketable, but also help you grow as an individual. A few of my interests that make me unique and set me apart are the following.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>14+ years of Chinese learning experience </li>
                            <li>Years of Leadership experience, including Team Captain, Student Government, and church leadership
                                responsibilities
                            </li>
                            <li>Interest in shoe making and grandma-style crafting.</li>

                        <h4>Soccer Experience</h4>
                        <p>I have played soccer since I was a little kid. I love this sport and it has been something that has helped me develop hard work, incredible stamina, and my messed up shins</p>

                        <p>When I was a young lad all I wanted was to play soccer at the collegiate level. For the longest time I dreamed and thought I would be a Utah Valley Wolverine. Turns out my dreams changed when I realized that Cougars could probably eat Wolverines. </p>
                        <p>Since coming to BYU, I have played on the Mens team, and we have had success. I just won my second NIRSA National Championship. We attended the National Soccer Championships sponsored by Pocari Sweat, in Round Rock Texas. It was here that we won for the 5th year in a row. If you don't know what NIRSA is, it's basically a step up from intramurls. Not bad for a couple 25 year old dads.</p>

                        <p>I look forward to continue plpaying soccer during my college career. I am grateful for the lessons learned and the opportunities I've had to continue growing this skill. The lessons of hard work and working with others on a team have been priceless.</p>
